# Path generation
The path generation is based on the "Project Walkthrough".

First, coarse waypoints on the correct trajectory are generated.
For this, either the current car's position and one previous point are used or the two endpoints of the previous trajectory, i.e. the last two points of the previous path that the car did not manage to reach during the last iteration.
These two points are the first two coarse waypoints.

Next, three points spaced 30m apart in Frenet space are generated on the correct lane and also added to the coarse waypoints.

To make the math nicer, these coarse waypoints are transformed into the local car coordinate system, so that they start at x,y,yaw all zero.

From these waypoints, a spline is constructed that allows the generation of evenly spaced smooth finer waypoints.

From the spline, 50 waypoints are generated in the following way:
1. All the points from the previous path that were not reached are reused as the first waypoints to make the trajectory smooth.
2. Up to a distance of 30m, new waypoints are generated by regularly increasing x and getting the y value from the spline.
3. The x increases depend on the desired reference velocity, which is set before the path is generated, such that the desired velocity is reached.
4. These waypoints are transformed back into the global coordinate frame and then sent to the simulator.
